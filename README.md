## WIP

This mod is a work in progress. Things might break or work in unexpected ways. There is also
currently a lack of documentation. This will improve over the coming weeks.

## Rules
Issues are for bug reports only.

PRs are for pull requests only.

Do not go and argue/chat there, you can do that on the discord.

## Building

### Windows

Install Visual Studio 2026 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload. The project builds
against the v145 toolset and the 10.0.26100 Windows SDK, so check that both are selected in the
installer.

The easiest route is to open `Sunrise.sln`, select the `Release` `x64` configuration and build.

To build from a command line, use the Developer PowerShell for VS 2026:

1. Clone the repository
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/stanuwu/Sunrise
cd Sunrise
```

2. Build the solution
```powershell
msbuild Sunrise.sln /m /p:Configuration=Release /p:Platform=x64
```

### Linux

Make sure you have `git`, `cmake`, `clang`, `ninja`, `llvm`, and `xwin` installed.

1. Clone the repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/stanuwu/Sunrise
$ cd Sunrise
```

2. Download Windows headers:
```bash
$ xwin --sdk-version 10.0.26100 --accept-license splat --include-debug-libs --output .xwin-cache
```

3. Configure and build the project
```bash
$ cmake -B build -G Ninja -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$(pwd)/linux-to-win-toolchain.cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ cmake --build build
```

## Contributing

Pull Requests are welcome. Please follow these rules:

- **No Copyrighted Data** - All game data should be extracted at runtime.
- **Code Formatting** - Stick to the provided clang-format and clang-tidy configs.
- **Clean Code** - Try to post readable high-quality code, follow the project's existing style of
  comment and add docs.
- **Provide Documentation** - Please explain what you changed, why you changed it and the effects it
  has in detail, it saves me a lot of work.
- **Follow Up** - If something with the PR is not right, I will reply and ask you to fix it.
- **One Feature** - Do not put multiple features into one PR.
- **Complete Implementations** - Do not PR features that are not completed and/or have non-functional parts.
- **Server Focus** - For features that are intended to be part of the server, don't abuse client patches. Sometimes it's needed but mostly everything should go through the right requests and pushes.
